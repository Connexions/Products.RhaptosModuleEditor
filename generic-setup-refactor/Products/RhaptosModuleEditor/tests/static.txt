Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosModuleEditor.LinksDiff import LinksDiff
    >>> type(LinksDiff.__implements__)
    <class 'Interface._InterfaceClass.Interface'>
    >>> LinksDiff.meta_type == 'Links Diff'
    True
